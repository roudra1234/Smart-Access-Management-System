# 🔐 Smart Access Management System

## 📌 Project Title & Short Description
Smart Access Management System is a **blockchain-based decentralized access control solution**.  
It manages user permissions through **smart contracts**, ensuring transparency, immutability, and security without relying on centralized authorities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- **Blockchain:** Stacks / Ethereum (choose based on deployment)  
- **Smart Contracts:** Clarity / Solidity  
- **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js  
- **Backend (optional):** Node.js / Express  
- **Database (optional):** IPFS / MongoDB / PostgreSQL  
- **Wallet Integration:** Stacks Wallet / MetaMask

   cd Smart-Access-Management-System

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**

   * Create a `.env` file
   * Add the following details:

     ```
     BLOCKCHAIN_NODE_URL=your_node_url
     PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key

## 📜 Smart Contract Address

* **Testnet Address:** `0x1234...abcd` *(replace with actual address)*
* **Mainnet Address:** `0x5678...efgh` *(replace with actual address)*

## 🚀 How to Use the Project

1. **Connect your wallet** (Stacks Wallet / MetaMask).
2. **Admin grants access** to users by interacting with the smart contract.
3. **Users request access** and the contract validates permissions on-chain.
4. **Transactions are recorded** permanently on the blockchain.
5. **Revoke or update access** seamlessly through the contract.
